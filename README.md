Proof of Concept for a Wargame type of game directly inspired by Warhammer Fantasy and Age of Sigmar.
Developed by Calvin Kurniawan Siauw

Contains a combat simulator and a demo unit.
Combat simulator has all of the necessary features for basic combat. There is one trigger for abilities that activates at the end of the round.

As mentioned it is more of a proof of concept and development will most likely continue in a real game engine such as Godot/Unity.
Fun personal project to help shake my rust off from Python programming
